to do

- use bg colors and icons according to message type
- better spacing for messages
- message attrs order: type, source, usage, content, etc
- function call order: name, id, arguments (format json)
- function response order: name, call_id, is_error, content

- Remove user message from agent config

I want you to change this just enought to make the icons and background colors to change slightly according to the type. The ones I see here are: TextMessage, ToolCallRequestEvent, ToolCallExecutionEvent and undefined.
Make it modular so I can control the colors by changing constants.
Be carefull not to change other styling or functionality.
