The backend provides the core agent logic, API modules, tool integrations, and voice functionality. It uses AutoGen (v0.5.x) for the agent runtime, with WebSocket streaming and dynamic selection of model clients like OpenAI or Gemini. The backend also manages a voice stack with a WebRTC bridge to OpenAI Realtime, allowing multiple browser clients to share a session.\n\nThe frontend is a React app with Material UI theming, routing, and pages for agent dashboards, a tool editor, and voice dashboards. It uses React 18, Material UI 5, Monaco Editor, Axios, and React Router v6.\n\nThe project structure includes:\n- Backend subfolders for configs, core agent logic, API modules, tool implementations, JSON configs, and tests.\n- Frontend organized by features, for agents, tools, and voice dashboards, plus shared components.\n\nKey dependencies on the backend include FastAPI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google generative clients, AutoGen, ChromaDB, and voice/WebRTC libraries like aiortc and pipecat. There’s also a separate Node package for Puppeteer-based screenshots and voice DB exports.\n\nTests are split into unit and integration tests under the backend, with a runner orchestrating the test execution.\n\nThis gives a solid starting point for analyzing or extending the project.",
