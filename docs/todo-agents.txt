User Assistant

I want you to please apply the following changes based on the models multimodality, the characteristics of the latest version of autogen (>0.4), and a clear understanding of all the code related to them:

x max_turns is not a model config, but a termination condition (as TERMINATE), so we should change this in the frontend.
- Allow access to the self agent instance from inside the tools file (to allow tools to change their agent's system prompt at runtime, for instance).
- Add optional code execution capabilities to group chat agent (option from autogen agents).
x Add direct audio input and output option (using multimodality).
x Add image input and output options.
  - Investigate how (and if necessary add ability) allow tools to send images to the model?

Please plan and execute all the changes step by step very carefully so you don't break any existing functionality.
