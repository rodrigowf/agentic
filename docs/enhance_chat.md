Thanks for confirming. I’ll now analyze the conversation page in the rodrigowf/agentic repo and provide precise, safe modifications to:

* Render the conversation as a chat UI (scrollable message list + input at the bottom)
* Auto-scroll to latest message on update
* Allow follow-up prompts to continue the same agent session with maintained context
* Disable the input while the agent is replying, but include an 'Interrupt' button to cancel the response

I'll get started and follow up with a detailed implementation plan and code snippets.


# Enhancements to Conversation UI and Multi-Turn Support

## Chat Interface Layout Updates

To present the agent conversation in a traditional chat format, we need to adjust the React/MUI layout so that messages stack vertically with newest at the bottom, and the input box fixed below the message list. In the current `RunConsole` component, the input field and "Run" button are rendered **above** the log output. We should reorder these elements: place the message list `<Paper ref={logContainerRef}>` container *above* the input box in the JSX, and the input box as the last element (fixed to bottom of the flex container). For example:

```jsx
return (
  <Stack spacing={2} sx={{ height: '100%', overflow: 'hidden', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
    <Box component={Paper} ...> {/* Header with status and controls */} </Box>

    {error && <Alert severity="error">...{error}...</Alert>}

    <Paper ref={logContainerRef} sx={{ flexGrow: 1, overflowY: 'auto', ... }}>
      {/* Map over messages (logs) here */}
    </Paper>

    <Box component={Paper} sx={{ p:2, display:'flex', gap:1, alignItems:'flex-start' }}>
      {/* TextField and Buttons for input */}
    </Box>
  </Stack>
);
```

In this structure, the `<Paper>` that displays the conversation messages uses `flexGrow: 1` and `overflowY: 'auto'` to fill the available space and scroll, while the input box container uses `flexShrink: 0` so it stays anchored at the bottom. We’ll preserve the existing auto-scroll behavior: the `useEffect` that scrolls `logContainerRef` to the bottom whenever new logs are added remains in place to ensure the view jumps to the latest message when it arrives.

Additionally, update the TextField label/placeholder to be more general (e.g. **“Message”** or **“Type your message…”** instead of “Initial Task for Agent”) since the input will be used for all conversation turns, not just the first. This makes the UI intuitive for follow-up prompts as well. The “Run” button can be relabeled to **“Send”** to reflect sending a chat message (the functionality is the same). These textual changes align the UI with a chat paradigm without affecting logic.

## Multi-Turn Conversation Support

To allow interactive multi-turn conversations with context retention, we must modify both the frontend logic and the WebSocket handling on the backend:

**Frontend:** Currently, each click of "Run" resets the log and starts a new session (the code replaces the `logs` state with a fresh array containing only a system message about sending the task). We should remove this reset. Instead, **append** the new user prompt to the log list. For example, in `handleRunAgent`, push a new log entry of type `"user"` with the `taskInput` content (and timestamp) before sending it. Then clear the input field for a clean slate. For instance:

```js
// Before sending the message:
setLogs(prev => [...prev, { type: 'user', data: taskInput, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() }]);
ws.current.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'run', data: taskInput }));
setTaskInput('');
setIsRunning(true);
setError(null);
```

By appending instead of replacing, the prior conversation remains visible. The user’s message will now appear in the chat log immediately, and the agent’s response (streamed events) will append after. We should also **not close** the WebSocket or clear logs after a single turn. The “Clear Logs”/“Reconnect” controls can still be available if the user explicitly wants to reset the session, but a normal conversation will reuse the same connection and log.

**Backend:** On the server side (FastAPI + WebSocket), we need to keep the agent session alive across messages. Currently, the `/api/runs/{agent_name}` endpoint reads one initial message and then, after processing, closes the socket. We will refactor this flow to support multiple client messages:

* **Persist the agent instance:** Load the agent config and tools as before, but instantiate the `AssistantAgent` (or `LoopingAssistantAgent`) once and reuse it for the entire WebSocket session. This means moving the agent creation out of the single-run block and into a broader scope (e.g. after accepting the WebSocket, before entering a message loop). The agent’s internal state (e.g. system prompt, conversation history) will then be maintained in memory. By reusing the same `assistant` object, it can remember prior turns, so the LLM receives context of previous user queries and answers. (The initial system prompt and any preset user prompt from the config should be applied once at agent creation.)

* **Message loop:** Wrap the interaction in a `while True` loop to continuously listen for incoming messages on the socket. For each message:

  * Await `websocket.receive_json()`. If the client sends a prompt (e.g. JSON `{type: "run", data: "...user text..."}`), retrieve the text. (On the first iteration, if no `data` is provided, fall back to `agent_cfg.prompt.user` as currently implemented, ensuring an initial task exists.)
  * Use the existing streaming mechanism to generate the agent’s answer with context. For example:

    ```python
    stream = assistant.run_stream(task=user_message, cancellation_token=cancellation_token)
    async for event in stream:
        event_type = event.__class__.__name__.lower()
        await send_event_to_websocket(websocket, event_type, event)
    ```

    This is similar to the current single-turn code, but now it runs for each user message. Do **not** re-initialize the agent or model client on subsequent turns – continue using the ones from the first turn so that conversation state isn’t lost.
  * After the stream completes for that user message, loop back to wait for the next message. Only break out of this loop if the connection is closed or if some explicit termination message is received (e.g., we could decide that an empty message or a special `"bye"` type ends the session, though typically the session ends when the socket closes).

* **Prevent auto-closure:** Remove or modify the code that closes the WebSocket at the end of `run_agent_ws`. In the current implementation, the server sends a `"Agent run finished."` system event and then closes the socket in a `finally` block, treating the run as one-and-done. We should eliminate this automatic closure so the socket remains open for additional messages. Likewise, skip sending the "Agent run finished." message after each turn, since the conversation isn’t truly finished – this extraneous system message can be omitted in a chat setting (the UI will infer the completion of a response when the agent stops streaming). We will only close the WebSocket when the client disconnects or in case of a fatal error. The FastAPI endpoint’s loop will thus continue running, handling each new prompt sequentially.

These changes ensure that after the agent responds, the connection stays alive and the agent retains all prior dialogue context in memory (the `AssistantAgent` history). The user can type a follow-up question, the frontend sends it over the same socket, and the backend’s loop dispatches it to the existing agent instance. The LLM will receive the conversation history (managed internally by the agent) along with the new query, and produce a context-aware response. From the user’s perspective, it behaves like a continuous chat – each user message yields an AI reply that remembers the discussion so far.

Importantly, none of this breaks existing functionality: starting a conversation still works as before (just with the UI in chat form), and the user can always manually reset by refreshing or using the provided “Clear”/reconnect button (which will establish a new socket and thus a new agent instance as it does currently). Tool usage and other agent features continue to function, now with the ability to carry their results or the conversation’s state into subsequent turns if needed.

## Input Control and Interrupting Responses

During agent generation, the input should be disabled and an **“Interrupt”** button provided to let the user cancel a long or unwanted response. The UI already disables the TextField and Run button when `isRunning` is true (note the `disabled={!isConnected || isRunning}` props on the input and button). We will keep that behavior. The new addition is an Interrupt control that is enabled only while the agent is responding.

**Frontend:** We can add an `IconButton` or small `Button` for interruption next to the send button. For example, an outlined button labeled "Stop" (or a stop icon) that is conditionally rendered when `isRunning` is true. In the JSX for the input box (within the same `Box` as the TextField and Send button), include something like:

```jsx
{isRunning && (
  <Button variant="outlined" color="error" onClick={handleInterrupt}>
    Stop
  </Button>
)}
```

This button should call a new `handleInterrupt` function. In `handleInterrupt`, we signal the backend to cancel the ongoing run. We will do this **without closing the socket** (so the session can continue). For instance:

```js
function handleInterrupt() {
  if (ws.current && ws.current.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
    ws.current.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'cancel' }));
  }
}
```

We send a JSON message of type `"cancel"` (we'll handle this on the server next). The moment the user clicks Interrupt, the UI can also provide feedback: for example, you might disable the Stop button itself or change its label to "Stopping…". The `isRunning` state will soon be updated to false when the cancellation is processed, re-enabling the input. (We should extend our `onmessage` handler to cover the cancellation event: currently it checks for `'error'`, `'system: Agent run finished'`, etc.. We can add a condition that if a system message arrives saying "Agent run cancelled externally", we set `isRunning(false)` as well to unblock the UI. Since the backend will send a system confirmation on cancel, as described below, we can detect that.)

For example, extend the onmessage logic like so:

```js
} else if (messageTypeLower === 'system' 
           && messageData.data?.message?.includes('cancelled externally')) {
  setIsRunning(false);
}
```

This ensures that when the agent stops mid-response due to interruption, the UI knows the generation ended. The log of events will include a system entry about the cancellation (which can be shown in the chat or could be filtered out as needed).

**Backend:** We utilize the existing cancellation mechanism in the agent runner. The code already creates a `CancellationToken` and passes it into `assistant.run_stream(...)`. If this token’s `cancel()` method is called, the running LLM/tool loop will terminate and raise an `asyncio.CancelledError`, which the code currently catches to log a message and send a system event. We will leverage this by listening for our new `"cancel"` message:

* Inside the WebSocket loop, handle messages of type `"cancel"`. When such a message is received, call `cancellation_token.cancel()`. This will signal the running `run_stream` generator to stop. Because the server is single-threaded in this async function, we can’t actually receive a cancel command **during** the `async for event in stream` loop without some parallel task. A straightforward approach is to spawn a background task to listen for control messages while the main loop is streaming results. For instance, create an `asyncio.create_task` that waits for a cancel instruction on the websocket. If it receives one, it cancels the token. Meanwhile, the main task is iterating through the stream. As soon as the token is cancelled, the `run_stream` loop will break (the Autogen agent should gracefully stop or throw a Cancelled error). We then clean up that background listener task. This design allows the cancel command to be received asynchronously without closing the socket.

* Simpler: since the UI disables additional prompts while running, the only message we expect during a generation is a cancel. We could alternate between waiting for either an event or a cancel. For example, use `asyncio.wait()` on two coroutines: the agent stream and a `websocket.receive_json()` waiting for a cancel. Whichever finishes first determines the outcome (if the cancel message arrives first, cancel the token and then await the stream to end; if the stream ends first, cancel the waiting-for-cancel task). This avoids thread conflicts on the socket. Implementing this carefully ensures we don’t miss messages. The end result is that a `"cancel"` from the client triggers `cancellation_token.cancel()`, causing the running agent to stop almost immediately.

* When a cancellation occurs, the backend should inform the client. The code already does this by sending a system message `"Agent run cancelled externally."` when it catches the `CancelledError`. We will keep that. We should also *not* treat this as a fatal error – do not close the WebSocket. Instead, after cancellation, we remain in the outer loop ready to accept the next user prompt. The agent instance is still alive and retains all conversation history up to the point of interruption (the partially generated answer may be incomplete, but that’s acceptable). The user can then ask a new question or rephrase, and the conversation continues.

Putting it together, after these changes the user can click **Interrupt** at any time while the agent is streaming a response. The UI will immediately send the cancel signal and shortly thereafter receive confirmation. The in-progress answer will stop (any partial text already sent stays in the log unless you choose to remove it), and `isRunning` becomes false, re-enabling the text box. The user can then type a follow-up or a new query without starting over, as the same session persists. This improves the usability (no need to wait through a long irrelevant answer) and aligns with typical chat interfaces (e.g. ChatGPT’s “Stop Generating” button).

All proposed modifications work with the existing FastAPI+WebSocket architecture and the React/MUI frontend without breaking functionality. We’ve essentially transitioned from a one-shot “console log” style interface to a persistent chat session interface:

* **Frontend:** Reorganized the component layout for chat, kept auto-scrolling, and appended messages to a running list. We maintain disabling of input while busy and add an Interrupt control.
* **Backend:** Used a persistent agent for the session, looping on the WebSocket to handle multiple turns, and implemented a cancellation pathway.

These changes allow users to have a natural back-and-forth conversation with the agent, with the UI/UX of a chat application, while preserving the underlying features (tool usage, logging of intermediate events, etc.) of the Agentic system.

**Sources:**

* Current input placement and rendering in `RunConsole.js`, and log container setup.
* Auto-scroll effect on new messages.
* Current WebSocket message handling and run initiation.
* Backend WebSocket run handler closing after one message.
* Cancellation token usage in agent runner (on disconnect or external cancel).
