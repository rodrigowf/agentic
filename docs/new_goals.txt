Now that you know the codebase and what this project is about, I'd like you to take a look to the codebase again in order to change the conversation page in the following ways:
- The conversation must look like a chat: with the input box at the bottom, and the messages list should automatically scroll to the bottom at every new message.
- The chat system must allow me to follow up with the conversation, allowing me to send new messages to the agent after they answer to my first question.
Please suggest precise changes that work and doesn't break the app.

Now that you know the codebase and what this project is about, I think you can create something very special to me: Please create an agent (like backend/agents/Researcher.json and backend/tools/research.py) with both Json and tools functions that can create any other agents using any of the app's features. This agent should be capable of generating other agents and tools.
