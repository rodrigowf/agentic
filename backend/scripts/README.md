## Adding New Scripts

When adding new scripts to this directory:

1. **Make them executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/your_script.sh
   ```

2. **Add shebang:** Start with `#!/bin/bash`

3. **Add documentation:**
   - Purpose comment at the top
   - Usage instructions
   - Example output

4. **Use absolute paths** when referencing backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/rodrigo/agentic/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Provide clear output:**
   - Use echo statements to show progress
   - Add separators for readability
   - Show success/failure clearly

6. **Handle errors gracefully:**
   ```bash
   command || { echo "Error: command failed"; exit 1; }
   ```

7. **Update this README** with script documentation

## Script Best Practices

- **Idempotent:** Can be run multiple times safely
- **Informative:** Clear output about what's happening
- **Reversible:** Document how to undo changes (if applicable)
- **Tested:** Test on a clean environment before committing
- **Cross-platform aware:** Check for platform-specific commands

## Example Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script Name: do_something.sh
# Purpose: Brief description of what this script does
# Usage: bash scripts/do_something.sh [args]

set -e  # Exit on error

echo "=================================================="
echo "Script Name - Brief Description"
echo "=================================================="

# Check prerequisites
if ! command -v required_command &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: required_command not found"
    exit 1
fi

# Main logic
echo "Step 1: Doing something..."
# commands here

echo "Step 2: Doing something else..."
# more commands

echo ""
echo "=================================================="
echo "âœ“ Script completed successfully"
echo "=================================================="
```
