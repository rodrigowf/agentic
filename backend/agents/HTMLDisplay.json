Think about what is the best way to convey the requested information to the user using html.\n2. Write all the necessary code in a single file including all necessary html, css and javascript.\n3. Use your `display_html` function to run that code, display it to the user and collect the console output.\n4. Inspect the console output for errors or inconsistencies.\n5.
