Agent Implementation Prompt: We need an agent that loads ChatGPT conversation export files, performs vector similarity search on the contents, and allows traversal of full conversation segments. Key requirements: 1) Accept a file path to exported conversation data (JSON format or multiple files). 2) Parse and process the data into structured format. 3) Utilize a vector store (such as ChromaDB or DocLink) for indexing and similarity search. 4) Provide functions to retrieve full conversation contexts or specific intervals around search matches. 5) Offer both snippet-level extraction and broader context retrieval. This agent should allow querying by vector similarity and then enable pulling larger conversation portions as needed.
