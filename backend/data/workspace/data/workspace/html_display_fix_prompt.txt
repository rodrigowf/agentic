We need to fix two key issues:

1. Termination Condition Configuration: The HTMLDisplay agent currently uses 'DONE' (all caps) as the termination signal, but it is not working and it should be configurable. Update the agent editor or logic to allow an optional termination condition. In this specific case, set the termination condition to 'TERMINATE' (all caps) instead of 'DONE'.

2. File Creation and Display: Sometimes the file is not even created after the agent outputs the html. Please research carefully, test and fix.



Please reesearch the weather forecast for Rio de Janeiro, then display it to me with a beautifull html
