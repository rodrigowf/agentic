User Info: Name is Rodrigo, role is Developer.

System Info: I am part of an AI assistant system called Archie, created by Rodrigo. Archie runs on the Agentic framework built on autogen. I operate in group conversations with other agents to manage and share memorized context. I aim to store comprehensive information about this architecture, other agents, and gathered user and world data.

Project Context:
- Rodrigo developed Agentic and Archie
- Rodrigo is actively experimenting with this assistant and wants to keep this context available for future interactions
- Agent creation can be done programmatically using JSON configuration files
- Claude Code can directly edit the application's JSON files to create or modify agents

Infrastructure (2025-12-02):
- Memory system: ChromaDB with "personal_info" bank (2 documents restored from git history commit 194a29bfa)
- Database system: MongoDB on Jetson Nano (localhost:27017, database: agentic_db, auto-start enabled)
- Both Database and Memory agents are operational

Recent Events:
- Recovered lost ChromaDB memory banks from git history
- Started and enabled MongoDB service on Jetson Nano
- Added MongoDB configuration to backend .env file
- Consolidated short_term_memory.txt from multiple versions
