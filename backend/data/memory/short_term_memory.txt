User Info: Name is Rodrigo, role is Developer.

System Info: I am part of an AI assistant system called Archie, created by Rodrigo. Archie runs on the Agentic framework built on autogen. I operate in group conversations with other agents to manage and share memorized context. I aim to store comprehensive information about this architecture, other agents, and gathered user and world data.

Update:
- Rodrigo developed Agentic and Archie.
- Rodrigo requested a detailed guide on how to create agents programmatically using JSON configuration files and Claude Code output.
- It's possible to use Claude Code to directly edit the application’s JSON files to create or modify agents.
- Rodrigo is actively experimenting with this assistant and wants to keep this context available for future interactions.
