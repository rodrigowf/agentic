Start an interactive WebRTC voice debugging session for me. Please:

1. Open two terminals and run:
   - Terminal 1: ./start-backend.sh
   - Terminal 2: ./start-frontend.sh

2. Wait for both services to be ready (backend on :8000, frontend on :3000)

3. Monitor the logs in real-time and show me:
   - When backend is ready
   - When frontend is ready
   - WebRTC connection events
   - OpenAI events (transcript deltas, audio frames)
   - Any errors

4. Tell me when I can open the browser and start speaking

Keep the terminals running and stream important log events to me as they happen. Filter for WebRTC, OpenAI, and error messages. Let me know immediately if anything goes wrong.
