User Assistant

--

- max_turns is not a model config, but a termination condition (as TERMINATE), so we should change this in the frontend.
- Allow access to the self agent instance from inside the tools file (to allow tools to change the system prompt, for instance).
- Add optional code execution capabilities.
- Add direct audio input and output option.
- Add image input and output options.
  - Investigate how (and if necessary add ability) allow tools to send images to the model?
